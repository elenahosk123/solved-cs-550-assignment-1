<h2>1.     Agents</h2>

In         order    to         prevent infections          from     E.         Coli,     ensuring           that      the       food      reaches a          minimum          internal temperature      of         160°     F.         A precept          that      could    be        implemented     to         ensure  that      food      is          free      of         E. Coli      would   be        to         monitor the       temperature      of         the soup           as        it          is          being    prepared.

<h2>2.     Problem  3.6b from the  text</h2>

<strong>Initial    State:</strong>   There   are       two       3          foot      crates   that      can       be        moved  by        the       monkey (3ft       tall),      who      cannot currently           reach    the bananas      on        the       celling   (8ft       in         height).

<strong>Goal     State/Test:</strong>       The      Monkey can       reach    the       tasty     bananas.

<strong>Successor:</strong>      RESULT(Starting          Stack,   Add(Crate)        /           Remove(Crate)) =          Crate    Stack

<strong>Cost     Function:</strong>         The      number of         bananas           the       monkey can       reach    (initially 0).        We       could    also      define   cost      by how      long      it takes the       monkey to         get       the       bananas.          It          depends           on        what     we        are       optimizing         for, bananas           or         speed.
